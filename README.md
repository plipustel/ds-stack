# STACK
In data structures and computer science, a "stack" is an abstract data type that follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle. It is a linear data structure that behaves like a physical stack or pile of items, such as a stack of plates.

Here are the main operations associated with a stack:
<ul>
<li><code>Push:</code> This operation is used to add an element to the top of the stack. When you push an element onto the stack, it becomes the new top.
</li>
<li>
<code>Pop:</code> This operation is used to remove the top element from the stack. After the pop operation, the element that was below the removed one becomes the new top.
</li>
<li>
<code>Peek or Top:</code> This operation allows you to look at the top element without removing it from the stack.
</li>
<li>
<code>isEmpty:</code> This operation checks whether the stack is empty or not. If the stack is empty, it means there are no elements in it.
</li>
<ul>
Stacks are commonly used for various tasks, including managing function calls in programming (the call stack), undo/redo functionality in software, and parsing expressions, among others. Stacks can be implemented using arrays or linked lists, and they are useful for situations where you need to keep track of items in a last-in, first-out order.

# REAL WORLD IMPLEMENTATION

In real-world application projects, implementing a stack is not a common practice in the same way it's used in data structures and algorithms. However, there are specific scenarios within various software applications where you might use a stack or a stack-like structure to manage certain aspects. Here are some scenarios when you might consider implementing a stack or stack-like behavior in your application:
<ul>
<li><code>Undo/Redo Functionality:</code> This is one of the most common scenarios. If your application involves complex user interactions (e.g., graphic design software, text editors, CAD applications, etc.), implementing a stack to manage undo and redo actions can be incredibly valuable. Users can undo their previous actions and redo them, providing a better user experience.
</li>
<li>
<code>Navigation History: </code>In web applications, you can use a stack-like structure to manage navigation history. When a user navigates through pages or views, you can push the visited pages onto a stack. This allows users to go back to the previous page (pop) or forward to the next page (if you've implemented a redo stack).
</li>

<li>
<code>Form Data Management:</code> If your application involves forms with dynamic elements (e.g., adding/removing form fields), a stack can be used to track these changes. Users can undo their additions and removals easily.
</li>

<li>
<code>Recursive Algorithms:</code> Some algorithms require a stack to manage recursive calls. For instance, parsing arithmetic expressions, traversing graphs or trees, or backtracking algorithms often use a stack to keep track of state and return values.
</li>

<li>
<code>Function Call Tracking:</code> In performance profiling tools, you might use a stack to track function calls, their parameters, and execution times to analyze and optimize code.
</li>

<li>
<code>Task Management:</code> In some task or workflow management applications, you can use a stack-like structure to track the hierarchy of tasks or subtasks. Users can navigate up and down the hierarchy easily.
</li>

<li>
<code>Game State Management: </code>In game development, especially in game development engines, you may use a stack to manage game states (e.g., menus, gameplay, pause screens). It helps with transitioning between different game states.
</li>

<li>
<code>Backtracking Algorithms:</code> If your application involves solving problems by exploring various paths (e.g., chess, mazes, or puzzle-solving apps), a stack can help keep track of the choices and backtrack when necessary.
</li>

<li>
<code>Resource Management:</code> In applications with limited resources (e.g., memory or connections), a stack can be used to manage resource allocation and deallocation.
</li>
</ul>
In these scenarios, implementing a stack or a stack-like structure simplifies the management of state, history, or user interactions. However, you should always assess the specific needs of your application and choose the appropriate data structure or design pattern accordingly. In many modern software projects, you'll find that libraries, frameworks, or design patterns handle these scenarios, reducing the need for you to implement a stack from scratch.
